Dear developer,

We hope you are doing well! 

As part of the customer project for our core product, we have a task that we'd like you to handle. 
Your expertise is needed to modify the welcome display message for two specific customers projects.

The core team has already provided us with a new version of core.dll for this purpose.

**NOTE: We want to emphasize that while working on this task, it's essential to refrain from making any changes </br>
to the core project. It should solely serve as a reference and for better understanding.**

The welcome message should be displayed during the PointOfSale.ShowWelocmeScreen method.</br>
Your objective is to extend the core team's message by incorporating the customer's country name.

For instance, if the core message is: "Hello Passport-X : your mgic number is --> 56"</br>
the message for the **Italy** customer will be: "Hello Passport-X  **Italy** : your magic number is --> 56"</br>
the message for the **France** customer will be: "Hello Passport-X **France** : your magic number is --> 56"

**It is crucial to ensure that, apart from this modification,</br>
the code must retain the same behavior as defined by the core team.**

We believe in your abilities and wish you the best of luck with the implementation!</br>
Should you have any questions or need any assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your dedication and efforts on this project!

Best regards,</br>

PPX team
